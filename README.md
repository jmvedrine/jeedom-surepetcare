# Jeedom plugin for Sure Petcare connected products for pets.

<img src="plugin_info/surepetcare_icon.png" align="right">

This is a plugin for the Jeedom (https://www.jeedom.com) open source (https://github.com/jeedom) home automation system.

It will permit to control the Sure Petcare connected products for pets from your Jeedom.

It has be tested with cat flaps (Pet Porte Connect and the smaller Microchip Cat Flap Connect) and also the Feeder Connect as there are the only Sure Petcare connected products that I own.
Some tests were done with the Felaqua Fountain and it is also supported to some extend.

When new connected products are added I will try to upgrade the plugin to support them.

This is currently a beta release. The most up-to-date version is in the beta branch.

If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please open an issue.
